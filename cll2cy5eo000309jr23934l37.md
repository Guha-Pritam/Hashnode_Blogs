1. `Test Cases:` Review and create test cases that cover all possible scenarios, including positive and negative test cases.
    
2. `Start Testing Early:` Begin testing as early as possible in the development process to catch defects early and reduce the cost of fixing them.
    
3. `Automate:` If There are many common test cases and the test actions are common, then automate all the common test cases. It will save time.
    
4. `Functionalities:` You should verify all the test cases' functionality and understand the user expectations.
    
5. `Error Handling:` Check how the software handles errors and exceptions to prevent unexpected behavior. Try to solve those errors as soon as possible.
    
6. `Documentation:` Review and ensure that the software documentation is complete and up-to-date. Create test cases for every test case.
    
7. `Accessibility:` Check the software's accessibility for users with disabilities, ensuring it adheres to accessibility standards.
    
8. `Error Reporting:` Ensure that the software generates appropriate error messages and logs for effective troubleshooting.
    
9. `Defects:` Observe and document any defects or issues found during testing. This includes capturing steps to reproduce the defects and providing detailed information for developers to fix them.
    
10. `Output:` Every function's output or result should be observed and understood.
