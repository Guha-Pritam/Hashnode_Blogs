To create a new React project, we can use `create-react-app`, a popular tool that sets up a new React project with all the necessary configurations and dependencies.

### What is the difference between npm and npx?

### `npm :`

* It helps to install packages separately.
    
* This package manager manages and shares the packages for React or Angular.
    
* It is free to use.
    

### `npx :`

* With this, we can install every useful or needed project-related package at a time.
    
* It will help to install all the packages at once. So, we don't need to install every time between projects.
    
* NPX is a package executer.
    

### `Step - 1` :

Install create-react-app globally. Open your terminal and run the following command.

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

### `Step - 2` :

Now we should select the path where we want to create the project.

```bash
cd path/to/your/project/directory
```

Then, run the following command to create the project:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

### `Step - 3` :

Now, you can start the development server to see your React app in action. Run the bellow command:

```bash
npm start
```
