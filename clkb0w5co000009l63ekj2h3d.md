### `An Overview and Some Concepts:`

* `Publish-Subscribe Pattern:` In MQTT the process of sending messages is called publishing, and to receive messages an MQTT client must subscribe to an MQTT topic.
    
* A client can only publish messages to a `single topic`, and **cannot publish** to a `group of topics`.
    
* Anyone Can easily send data from a `single device` to `thousands`.
    
* MQQT can be used to communicate between two physical systems.
    
* For any automation, we can use this as a `command-wise` action.
    

### `What is the meaning of Publish?`

Publish means only sending any data or sending any message.

* A device can `publish` on any topic it chooses.
    
* The publisher should publish the data on the topic.
    

### `What is the meaning of Subscribe?`

Subscribing makes the device receive any data or any message.

### `What is the meaning of the Topic?`

Publishers and subscribers want one topic for sending and receiving data. ***Topics*** receive the delivery ***message*** and send them. A topic is a type of place where all data is stored. Without this, They can create the connection but cannot send or receive the data.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">In Topic, don't use the 4 slash "/" for topic creation.</div>
</div>
